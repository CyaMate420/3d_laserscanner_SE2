# 3d_laserscanner_SE2
This repository was created as a collaborative tool for completing the code concerning our 3D-LaserScanner as the final project for 5. semester  course "Sensortechnik 2" at University of Applied Sciences Saarland (htw saar).

....
This repository consists of the up-to-date (04.03.2022) ESP32 code (Arduino IDE) to run the 3d laser scnaner, the seperate MatLab code integrated into the ESP32 code and a folder with all used libraries.

....
Code gets updated everytime one of the group members makes changes and commits them to the repository. Final changes are getting pushed by Kurza1996 or CyaMate420 after reviewing the commits or pull requests.
